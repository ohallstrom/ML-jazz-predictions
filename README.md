### Predicting the next chord in Jazz music through Machine Learning

* Ongoing project

By training a LSTM on data from the [Weimar Jazz Database](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dboverview.html), we are in this project investigating if the lead melody, in addition to the previously played chords, contains information that helps the prediction of the next chord.

Made by Anmol, Nikunj and Oskar in collaboration with the Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab at EPFL.
