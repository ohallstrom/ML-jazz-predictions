### Use machine learning to predict the next chord in Jazz music

* Ongoing project

By training a LSTM on data from the [Weimar Jazz Database](https://jazzomat.hfm-weimar.de/dbformat/dboverview.html), we are in this project investigating if the lead melody, in addition to the previously played chords, contains information that helps the prediction of the next chord.

Made by Anmol, Nikunj and Oskar in collaboration with the Digital and Cognitive Musicology Lab at EPFL.
